Cipher block chaining or CBC is an advancement made on ECB since ECB compromises some security requirements. In CBC, the previous cipher block is given as input to the next encryption algorithm after XOR with the original plaintext block. In a nutshell here, a cipher block is produced by encrypting an XOR output of the previous cipher block and present plaintext block.

# Questions for the Proffessor
- can we use common libraries like numpy?
- are we supposed to make the project in a container or provide a virtual env. for it to run in?
- can we use external libraries for finding large primes?
